abstract = {Free Space Optical communications (FSO) has attracted considerable attention for a variety of applications in telecommunications field. This technology uses the transmission of an optical or infrared (IR) signal in the atmosphere to provide high data rate reliable more economically than traditional fiber. Some of FSO advantages are: spectrum licensing, frequency coordination, no interference, fast and easy installation, multi-Gbps high data rate, low cost. This communication presents various atmospheric considerations relating to the propagation such as absorption and scattering by molecular or aerosols, scintillation due to the air index variation under the temperature effect, attenuation by hydrometeors (rain, snow) like their various modelling (Kim and Kruse, Al Naboulsi, Carbonneau, etc). Some experimental results (attenuation in function of the visibility) are presented. The comparison of measurements with our model shows a good agreement for low visibility where Kruse and Kim models deviate notably from measurements.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate (in)security aspects of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) proto- col. ADS-B is intended to be widely deployed in Air Traffic Management (ATM) Surveillance systems by 2020. One of the goals of ADS-B is to increase safety of air traffic. While the security of ADS-B was previously questioned, in this paper we demonstrate that attacks are both easy and practically feasible, for a moderately sophisticated attacker. Attacks range from passive attacks (eavesdropping) to active attacks (message jamming, replaying of injection). The attacks have been implemented using an Universal Soft- ware Radio Peripheral (USRP), a widely available Software- Defined Radio (SDR). for which we developed an ADS-B receiver/transmitter chain with GNURadio. We then present and analyze the results of the implemented attacks tested against both USRP-based and commercial-off-the-self (COTS) radio-enthusiast receivers. Subsequently, we discuss the risks associated with the described attacks and their implication on safety of air-traffic, as well as possible solutions on short and long terms. Finally, we argue that ADS-B, which is planned for long-term use, lacks the minimal and necessary security mechanism to ensure necessary security of the air traffic},

It is well understood that the unmanned aircraft system (UAS) industry is highly dynamic and constantly evolving with the advancement of science and technological enablement. As such, the aim of this text is to identify and survey the fundamentals of UAS operations, which will serve as either a basic orientation to UAS or as a foundation for further study. This contributed work targets introductory collegiate courses in UASs and was birthed out of an unsuccessful search for suitable texts for such a course. The chapters have been individually contributed by some of the nation’s foremost experts in UAS operations at the collegiate level; therefore, the reader may note some variation in writing style. It was decided to leave the contribu- tions in this form in the interest of preserving the author’s intent, thereby improving the quality of information contained herein. This text is written from a nonengineer- ing, civilian, operational perspective aimed at those who will operate or employ UASs for a variety of future missions.

abstract = {In this technical report we describe our efforts towards a field deployable Sense and Avoid system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which uses passive vision as the main sensing modality. The ability of UAVs to operate safely in the presence of other air traffic is critical towards acceptance of UAVs in civilian and military airspace. This will allow UAVs to be used to their fullest potential. In order to operate freely in the presence of manned airborne traffic UAVs must demonstrate a Sense and Avoid capability that meets or exceeds that of an equivalent human pilot. Furthermore this capability should be achieved without the use of cooperative communication with other aircraft or prior knowledge of other aircrafts’ flight plans. We describe our collision avoidance algorithm and software-in-the- loop testing, vision based detection method with a 98{\%} detection rate out to a range of 4.5 miles which exceeds the FAA regulation of 3 statute miles. A field deployable Sense and Avoid system must be able to operate with consistent performance across a variety of atmospheric conditions including cloud, fog and haze of various degrees that can occur under conditions commonly described as Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). In order to model the effect of all these conditions on the performance of the detection system we developed an atmospheric image formation modelling system that takes as inputs weather conditions and can predict the appearance of the image of an aircraft of given geometry at various ranges. This predictive model also determines the minimum resolution needed to guarantee the required detection performance. Passive vision provides the bearing to the intruding aircraft. Range estimation is only possible by executing additional maneuvers which causes significant mission interference. We investigate the feasibilty of a flash lidar system that can be used as a confirming sensor to further reduce the false positive rate and provide range of the intruding aircraft. 1},

abstract = {Integrating drones into the civil airspace is one of the biggest challenges for civil aviation, responsible authorities and involved com- panies around the world in the upcoming years. For a full integration into non-segregated airspace such a system has to provide the capability to automatically detect and avoid other airspace users. Electro-optical cameras have proven to be an adequate sensor to detect all types of aerial objects, especially for smaller ones such as gliders or paragliders. Robust detection and tracking of approaching traffic on a potential collision course is the key component for a successful avoidance maneuver. In this paper we focus on the aerial object tracking during dynamic flight maneuvers of the own-ship where accurate attitude information corresponding to the camera images is essential. Because the ’detect and avoid’ functionality typically extends existing autopilot systems the received attitude measurements have unknown delays and dynamics. We present an efficient method to calculate the angular rates from a multi camera rig which we fuse with the delayed attitude measurements. This allows for estimating accurate absolute attitude angles for every camera frame. The proposed method is further integrated into an aerial object tracking framework. A detailed evaluation of the pipeline on real collision encounter scenarios shows that the multi camera rig based attitude estimation enables the correct tracking of approaching traffic during dynamic flight, at which the tracking framework previously failed.},

abstract = {The goal of integrating drones into the civil airspace requires a technical system which robustly detects, tracks and finally avoids aerial objects. Electro-optical cameras have proven to be an adequate sensor to detect traffic, especially for smaller aircraft, gliders or paragliders. However the very challenging environmental conditions and image artifacts such as lens flares often result in a high number of false detections. Depending on the solar radiation lens flares are very common in aerial images and hard to distinguish from aerial objects on a collision course due to their similar size, shape, brightness and trajectories. In this paper we present an efficient method to detect lens flares within aerial images based on the position of the sun with respect to the observer. Using the date, time, position and attitude of the observer we predict the lens flare direction within the image. Once the direction is known the position, size and shape of the lens flares are extracted. Experiments show that our approach is able to compensate for errors in the parameters influencing the calculation of the lens flare direction. We further integrate the lens flare detection into an aerial object tracking framework. A detailed evaluation of the framework with and without lens flare filter shows that false tracks due to lens flares are successfully suppressed without degrading the overall tracking system performance.},

abstract = {The integration of drones into the civil airspace is still an unresolved problem. In this paper we present an experimental Sense and Avoid system integrated into an aircraft to detect and track other aerial objects with electro-optical sensors. The system is based on a custom aircraft nose-pod with two integrated cameras and several additional sensors. First test flights were successfully completed where data from artificial collision scenarios executed by two aircraft were recorded. We give an overview of the recorded dataset and show the challenges to be faced with processing videos from a mobile airborne platform in a mountainous area. The proposed tracking framework is based on measurements from multiple detectors fused onto a virtual sphere centered at the aircraft position. To reduce false tracks from ground clutter, clouds or dirt on the lens, a hierarchical multi-layer filter pipeline is applied. The aerial object tracking framework is evaluated on various scenarios from our challenging dataset. We show that aerial objects are successfully detected and tracked at large distances, even in front of terrain.},

abstract = {This figure shows the solar radiation spectrum for direct light at both the top of the Earth's atmosphere and at sea level. The sun produces light with a distribution similar to what would be expected from a 5525 K (5250 °C) blackbody, which is approximately the sun's surface temperature. As light passes through the atmosphere, some is absorbed by greenhouse gases with specific absorption bands. Additional light is redistributed by Raleigh scattering, which is responsible for the atmosphere's blue color. Since most of the absorption bands are located away from the peak in solar radiation, a majority ({\~{}}70{\%}) of the radiation from the sun reaches the Earth's surface. This is in contrast to the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth, whereby a majority is absorbed by bands occuring near the peak at {\~{}}5000 nm. This discrepancy, where solar light can easily reach the Earth's surface but returning energy is absorbed, is a defining quality of Earth's greenhouse effect. These curves are based on the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Terrestrial Reference Spectra, which are standards adopted by the photovoltaics industry to ensure consistent test conditions and are similar to the light that could be expected in North America. Regions for ultraviolet, visible and infrared light are indicated.},

abstract = {Research was conducted to determine the effective intensity of flashing lights that incorporate light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs require less power and have the ability to flash without the addition of moving parts. Compared with incandescent bulbs, however, LEDs yield a different spectral output and a different intensity profile when flashing. To determine the effect of these differences on a viewer’s ability to detect the light, we examined LEDs to determine if they can successfully replace legacy technologies/assemblies on aircraft. The LED was displayed to na{\"{\i}}ve subjects to establish visibility thresholds using an automated system to drive the LED with variable intensity and duration. Experimental data were examined to determine which model for effective intensity (Allard, Modified Allard, or Blondel-Rey) is most appropriate for LEDs. Each of the methods was found to be applicable dependent upon the system being considered. Use of the Blondel-Rey method produced acceptable but conservative results.},
